Compared to arrays they provide almost the same performance for these tasks plus they have the ability to be easily resized
Although they usually consume more memory than arrays when their capacity is handled automatically 
This is in order to accommodate extra storage space for future growth

Compared to the other base standard sequence containers deques and lists
vectors are generally the most efficient in time for accessing elements and to add 
or remove elements from the end of the sequence
For operations that involve inserting or removing of elements 
at positions other than the end they perform worse than deques and lists and have less consistent 
iterators and references than lists
